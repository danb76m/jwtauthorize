## Jwt Authorize Example
I made this to learn more about rust as well as authenticating JWT keys. Originally it was going to be used for Azure Tenant Directory. This project is a library that can be used in other actix-web based programs as a middleware. It caches Microsoft's public rotating keys using the moka library. It's pretty cool.
